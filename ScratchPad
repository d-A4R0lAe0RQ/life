This is just where I'm jotting down ideas.

Security:
	Ideal percentage of active participants armed = 25% or more = "Gunners"
	Specialized security personnel = 5% = "Guards"
	Specialized hunters = 5% = "Hunters"
	
Required Loadouts:
	Gunners = 9mm pistols
		Guards = 9mm carbines; shotgun, 1 per 3 Guards; intermediate-caliber rifles, 1 per 3 guards or as desired; .30 caliber rifle, 1 per 10 guards, reserved for 1 designated marksman
		Hunters = .30 caliber rifles; pellet air rifles (.177, .22 caliber) for small game and stealth hunts; shotguns borrowed from guards as necessary with good reason; other weapons optional if approved; intermediate-caliber discouraged for larger game (all hunting must be done humanely)

MANDATORY FIREARMS EDUCATION AND QUALIFYING PROCESS

Perhaps that's way too much security.

I bet /k/ would want in on this.


We should create and maintain "schools" where anyone can be a teacher and anyone can be a student.  Free, focus on learning, lots of attention; facilities may be used for 1-on-1 instruction as well.
Can we get a school "accredited" somehow?  Can we be recognized by the powers that be?  Can a person with a degree in Masturbation from Shit Lords University expect to get a job with that? (I kid)

HOW DO WE CHANGE THE WORLD FOR THE BETTER?
DO WE WANT TO CHANGE THE WORLD FOR OTHERS OR JUST FOR OURSELVES?
ARE WE SELFISH?  ARE WE SELFLESS?
ARE WE SHAPING THE WORLD TO OUR STANDARDS, OR ARE WE JUST FREEING IT FROM ITS CURRENT SHAPE?
