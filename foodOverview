§1. Farming
	a. Farming should be practiced as our primary means of food-gathering.
	b. A guide to farming may be found at /life/farming
§2. Trapping
	a. Trapping is the most humane way of taking game, as the animal's slaughter can be a controlled and deliberate humane process.  This stands in contrast with hunting (with a firearm or weapon) where slaughter is oftentimes improvised and inaccurate, and where mistakes may be made due to the "thrill of the hunt."
	b. A guide to trapping may be found at /life/trapping
	c. Guidelines for slaughtering, dressing, and preparing game may be found at /life/butcher
§3. Hunting
	a. Hunting is a last resort for procuring meat.  Care should be taken to do so humanely and sustainably.

§4. Fishing
	a. Fishing, where possible, is preferable to hunting game.  Its spoils are more nutritious and its environmental impact is less.  However, care must be taken to do so responsibly, humanely, and sustainably.
